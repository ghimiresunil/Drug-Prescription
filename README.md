## INTRODUCTION

In this Drug Prescription project, I have learned how to Deal with Data having Textual Features, also learned NLP Techniques to transform and Process the Data to find out Important Insights.

## FETURES OF DATASET
- **uniqueID**: Used to identifying all the Records in the Data uniquely
- **drugName**: Consists of the name of the drugs on which the consumers have given certain ratings and reviews.
- **condition**: Tells us about the medical condition for which the given drug is used.
- **review and rating**: Which is collected by patients after they have used that particular drug for their medical condition.
- **date**: Tells us that on which date the review and rating was collected by the patient.
- **usefulCount**: Gives us the information about the number of people who found a drug useful for their specified medical condition.

Note: The **usefulCount** column is the most important column as this gives a lot of confidence to the people for trusting on a drug for any specified medical condition.

## UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM

- Suppose there is a pharmaceutical startup that was recently acquired by one of the world's largest MNCs.
- For the acquisition process, the startup is required to tabulate all drugs that they have sold and account for each drug's effectiveness.
- Dataset contains info such as Drug's Name, reviews by customers, popularity and use case of the drug.

## TASK OF THR PROJECT

- Provide a sophisticated and useful model using different NLP or ML techniques.
- Find out the most useful drugs for each condition.
- Find out some of the hidden trends or patterns that could help the company to make precise data driven decisions.
